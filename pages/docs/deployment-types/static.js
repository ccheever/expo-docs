${<Now color="#000"/>} comes with a native support for static deployments. It considers all projects that don't have a \`Dockerfile\`, nor a \`package.json\` as a static deployment.

Deploying such a static project is still as easy as running a single command:

${<TerminalInput>now</TerminalInput>}

## Under the Hood

The technology behind our servers is a Node.js module called [serve](https://github.com/zeit/serve), which you can download, fork, extend and even operate locally during development.

What does this mean for your team and your business? Great user experience with zero lock-in.

If you canâ€™t wait for us to add a certain capability to our static deployments support, you can just create a \`package.json\` like this:

${
  <Code>{`{
  "name": "extensible",
  "scripts": {
    "start": "serve ."
  },
  "dependencies": {
    "serve": "latest"
  }
}`}</Code>
}

Then run \`now\`, and we will detect the presence of \`package.json\` and deploy it as a \`npm\` deployment.

## Deployment Inactivity

Old deployments always stay around forever if you don't remove them using \`now remove\`.

However, the new static deployments, without the \`package.json\` are **never** put to sleep but are always quickly accessible.
